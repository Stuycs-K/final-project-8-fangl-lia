### 05-22

Started on the Ball class; set up all fields and currently
working on constructor. Colors, type, and number are finalized.

### 05-23

Finished Ball constructor and show() method based on number, type,
and color. The only inaccuracy is that the number is colored white
and there is no white circle in the middle of the ball. This is
so the number is more readable.

Future status of rotating visuals is unclear.

### 05-24

Made significant progress on Ball physics, specifically movement and
friction on the table. Currently only implemented sliding friction, meaning
that the movement stops abruptly rather than lightly. Will implement
rolling friction soon.

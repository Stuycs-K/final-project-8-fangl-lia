# APCS Final Project

## Group Info
Created by Group **Megaclip**: Lingjie "Jack" Fang and Andrew Li.

## Overview
This is a 2D 8 ball pool game where two players take turns manipulating the
movement of billiard balls. The game simulates collisions and potting balls.
It also includes animations and sound. Normal 8-ball pool rules are implemented.

## Instructions
Past the starting screen, the game is played with typical 8 ball pool rules. A
description of these rules is given at the end of these instructions.

To aim a shot, the cue stick's direction follows the mouse, and there is a
guideline that marks the trajectory of the cue ball. In order to make a shot,
click to aim the cue stick. A power bar will appear on the left, and the
direction will remain stationary. Clicking outside of the power bar will reset
the direction and allow the player to aim again. Clicking inside of the power
bar will release the cue stick at a power based on the color of where the player
clicks: yellow represents low power, and red represents high power.

Turn order is determined first by **fouls**, and then by balls potted. If a
player commits a foul, turn passes to the next player and they may move the cue
ball. In order to move the cue ball, click on it and drag it to a desired
position on the table. It cannot, however, be placed outside a specific border,
which will light up.

If no fouls are committed and a player pots a ball legally, they may go again.

To win the game, a player must pot all of their balls and then the 8 ball legally.
A player may also win if their opponent incurs an **automatic loss**.
